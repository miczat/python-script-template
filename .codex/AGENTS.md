# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This file defines **persistent project guidance** for OpenAI Codex.  
Codex must read and follow these instructions when generating, modifying, or reviewing code in this repository.

If instructions in this file conflict with ad-hoc user prompts, **this file takes precedence unless explicitly overridden**.

---

## Project Overview

**Project name:** Feature Class Profiler – test data generator (fc_profiler_create_testdata.py)
**Primary domain:** GIS / data audit
**Primary language:** Python
**Target runtime:** Python 3.13.7 (ArcGIS Pro 3.6)

**High-level goals:**
- Script creation of geodatabase(s), feature class, fields, rows
- The resulting data is used with unit and integration tests for "fc_profiler"


## Coding Conventions (Must Follow)

### General
- Write **clear, explicit, readable code**
- Prefer **explicit over clever**
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction
- Favor small, composable functions
- Write for ease of reading and maintainability
- Keep the solution to a single file
- If requirements.md specifies hardcoded paths/env, implement exactly; do not generalize to CLI args.

### Python Standards (if applicable)
- Follow **PEP 8**
- Use **type hints** for public functions
- Prefer f-strings over `.format()`
- No global state unless explicitly justified

### Naming
- `snake_case` for variables and functions
- `PascalCase` for classes
- Constants in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Avoid ambiguous abbreviations unless domain-standard

### File and folder naming conventions

This project uses **explicit, `pathlib`-aligned variable naming** for files and directories.
The goal is clarity, consistency, and one-to-one mapping between variable names and
`pathlib.Path` attributes.

#### General rules

- Use `path` for full paths (`pathlib.Path` objects)
- Use `folderpath` for directory paths
- Use `foldername` for directory names only (no path)
- Use `filename` for file name including extension
- Use `name` for file name without extension
- Use `extension` for file extension (including the leading dot, unless explicitly stated)

Avoid ambiguous terms such as `dir`, `file`, `fname`, `pathstr`, or overloaded names like `fp`.

#### Standard `pathlib` mappings

| Variable name        | Meaning                              | `pathlib` equivalent |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `file_path`          | Full path to a file                  | `p`                  |
| `folder_path`        | Full path to parent directory        | `p.parent`           |
| `folder_name`        | Directory name only                  | `p.parent.name`      |
| `file_name`          | File name with extension             | `p.name`             |
| `file_stem`          | File name without extension          | `p.stem`             |
| `file_extension`     | File extension (with leading dot)    | `p.suffix`           |

#### Example

```python
from pathlib import Path

file_path = Path(r"C:\TEMP\A.JPG")

folder_path   = file_path.parent  # C:\TEMP
folder_name   = folder_path.name  # TEMP
file_name     = file_path.name    # A.JPG
file_stem     = file_path.stem    # A
file_extension = file_path.suffix # .JPG
```


### Imports
- Standard library first
- Third-party libraries second
- If importing arcpy, use a library in arcpy where a suitable library exists
- Local imports last
- Avoid wildcard imports except when importing ArcPy extension toolboxes where that is established project practice (e.g., arcpy.sa). Otherwise prefer explicit imports
- Remove unused imports; keep only what is required


### ArcGIS Pro / ArcPy constraints
 - Codex cannot execute ArcPy here; still write ArcPy code as required; include local run instructions and validations
 - Assume ArcGIS Pro is installed; script runs inside the ArcGIS Pro conda env; no third-party deps.
 - Target: Python environment is 3.13.7
 - Use arcpy.management.* tools and arcpy.da.InsertCursor 
 - Use SHAPE@ for geometry and wrap cursors in with blocks
 - Prefer arcpy.SpatialReference(<epsg>) over WKT strings
 - use arcpy.Describe(fc).spatialReference.factoryCode == <epsg> when comparing coordinate systems
 - Prefer arcpy.PointGeometry, arcpy.Array, arcpy.Polyline, arcpy.Polygon patterns for geometry creation
 - Prefer arcpy.ClearWorkspaceCache_management() before delete attempts (when applicable), and log potential lock sources.


---

## Logging & Error Handling

- Use the project’s standard logging configuration. Do not modify setup_logger() / CSV format unless explicitly requested.
- Do not use `print()` for operational logging.  print() is acceptable only as a fallback inside logger setup failure paths (when logging is not yet available).
- Raise meaningful exceptions
- Fail fast on invalid inputs

---
## Validation

Every validation failure must (1) log error with expected vs actual, then (2) raise.

---
## Dependency Management

- Do not introduce new dependencies without justification
- Prefer existing libraries already in use
- Document any new dependency in:
  - `README.md` (if user-facing)
---

## Git & Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

### Commit Messages
- **Use the commit message template defined in `.gitmessages`**
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Do not mix formatting changes with logic changes

### Branch Naming
```
feature/<short-description>
fix/<short-description>
refactor/<short-description>
```

### Pull Requests Must Include
- Clear description of **what changed and why**
- Reference to related issue/ticket (if applicable)
- Notes on testing performed
- Any known limitations or follow-ups

Codex should **follow these conventions when generating PR descriptions or commit messages**.

---

## What Codex Should NOT Do

- Do not reformat unrelated files
- Do not introduce new architectural patterns unprompted
- Do not remove existing functionality unless explicitly instructed
- Do not assume undocumented behavior

---

## When in Doubt

If requirements are unclear:
1. Ask a clarifying question **before** generating code
2. State assumptions explicitly
3. Prefer the simplest viable solution
